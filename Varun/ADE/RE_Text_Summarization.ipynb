The patient then developed oral sores and rash in the chest the night before admission which rapidly spread to the face, trunk, and upper extremities within the last 24 hours. The patient was unable to eat secondary to mouth pain. She had fevers, weakness, and diarrhea. There were no genital the morning of [**7-20**]. PAST MEDICAL HISTORY: 1. Hypercholesterolemia. 2. Benign right frontal cystic tumor status post right frontal craniotomy on [**2109-7-1**]. ALLERGIES: NO KNOWN DRUG ALLERGIES. MEDICATIONS: Lipitor, Tylenol with Codeine, Dilantin, previously on Decadron q.i.d. tapered over one week and discontinued a week ago. SOCIAL HISTORY: The patient lives with her husband, daughter, and son. [**Name (NI) **] smoking or ethanol use history. PHYSICAL EXAMINATION: Vital signs: T-max 104.3??????, currently 100.8??????, heart rate 107-110, blood pressure 110/27, respirations 15-20, oxygen saturation 98% on room air. General: The patient was an alert, ill-appearing woman with postsurgical occiput. Head and neck: Injected conjunctivae, greenish ocular discharge, ulcerative oral lesions. Cardiovascular: Regular rhythm. Rapid rate. No murmurs. Pulmonary: Clear to auscultation bilaterally. Abdomen: Normoactive bowel sounds. Soft, nontender, nondistended. Extremities: No edema. Skin: Diffuse erythema and pustules on the face. Patulous pustules on the chest, back, and proximal upper extremities. GU: No genital lesions. LABORATORY DATA: Hematocrit 34.1, WBC 10.3, platelet count 291,000, differential of 87 neutrophils, 0 bands; sodium 133, potassium 3.8, chloride 93, CO2 21, BUN 17, creatinine 0.9, glucose 121; ALT 39, AST 42, LDH 434, amylase 63, albumin 3.4, total bilirubin 0.3; urinalysis with positive ketones, negative nitrites; urine culture pending; blood cultures times two pending; conjunctival culture pending. HOSPITAL COURSE: Given the patient's severe exfoliative skin involvement with rapid progression and extensive involvement of the body, she was admitted to the Medical Intensive Care Unit for close monitoring. She was started on prophylactic Oxacillin to cover skin flora, and Dermatology was consulted along with Neurology and Ophthalmology for the ophthalmic involvement. The patient's course in the Intensive Care Unit was uneventful, and she was discharged to the floor with very close monitoring which included q.1 hour Pred Forte application to the eye and close consultation with Ophthalmology. With regard to her skin lesions, they continued exfoliate over the next couple of days, and her skin care included frequent Vaseline hydrated petroleum application to decrease insensible losses. The patient's intake and output were closely monitored and replaced appropriately; however, the intensive nursing care requirement made it difficult for the patient to receive adequate on the floor, and therefore, she was transferred to the Medical Intensive Care Unit again for frequent ophthalmic applications and skin care. While in the MICU, the patient continued to have meticulous skin care and eye care. The skin lesions continued to desquamate and exfoliate which is the natural progression of this disease. She began to have involvement of the genital area with continued desquamation of the exfoliative lesions. Her course in the Intensive Care Unit within the next 8-10 days was a slow but gradual improvement from a dermatologic and ophthalmologic standpoint. From a cardiovascular standpoint, she was in sinus tachycardia which was felt to be secondary to her [**Doctor Last Name **]-[**Location (un) **] syndrome leading to dehydration and insensible fluid losses. While in the Intensive Care Unit, she was also found to be mildly hypoxic which is likely secondary to atelectasis because of the patient's immobility. Lower extremity Dopplers were also done, and no deep venous thromboses were found. From and Infectious Disease standpoint, the patient was started on intravenous Oxacillin empirically. Blood cultures on the 5th was with no growth times two; however, one bottle from her PICC line grew out gram-positive cocci on [**7-27**]. She was started on a course of Vancomycin. Subsequently the organism was found to be CNS with Corynebacterium, and Vancomycin was discontinued prior to transfer to the floor on [**8-5**]. The patient's course on the floor was uncomplicated with continued improvement. Dermatology: The patient, as indicated, improved dramatically from her presentation to the time of discharge. Her exfoliative lesions healed over the course of this admission. Her skin care requirements decreased to Petroleum jelly twice a day at the time of discharge. She was able to take in oral foot without problems. Ophthalmology: The patient's eye care requirement improved markedly. She was able to open her eyes and use her vision without significant problems at the time of discharge. Her Pred Forte was discontinued on the day of discharge, and she is to have follow-up with Ophthalmology a couple of days after discharge. Fluid, electrolytes, and nutrition: On admission the patient was begun on TPN for nutritional support. As the patient improved from a medical perspective, her TPN was weaned, and at the time of discharge, the patient was taking adequate p.o. with supplementation of Boost. Infectious Disease: At the time of admission, she was started on empiric antibiotics and placed on contact precautions secondary to her extensive skin lesions; however, as the patient improved throughout the course of this admission, contact precautions were discontinued, and the patient was discharged home with services. Cardiology/Pulmonology: The patient was tachycardiac throughout this admission which was attributed to her fluid losses secondary to [**Doctor Last Name **]-[**Location (un) **] syndrome; however, given the patient's immobility throughout the course of this admission, a CT angiogram was performed to evaluate for possible pulmonary embolism, and none were found. Neurology: The patient has a history of cystic tumor status post resection in [**Month (only) 205**] of this year and was started on prophylactic Dilantin leading to presumed [**Doctor Last Name **]-[**Location (un) **] syndrome. At the time of this admission, the patient's Dilantin was discontinued, and no other anticonvulsants were started, given the patient's risk of seizures several weeks after her surgery was unlikely. This decision was made with the support of her neurosurgeon, Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) 1338**]. Five days before discharge, the patient did have a syncopal event while in the bathroom showering with the help of a nursing aide. The likely etiology of this is orthostatic hypotension from her fluid losses; however, given the patient's neurologic history, Neurology was consulted to evaluate for possible seizure. Neurology's recommendations were to obtain a repeat CT scan which was unchanged from previous showing a right frontal lobe extra-axial hypodensity which was stable. They also recommended repeat MR imaging which was again unremarkable except for a stable extra-axial lesion noted on CT scan. Neurology therefore agrees with the primary team that the syncopal event was likely secondary to a vasovagal reaction. A follow-up MR scan would be recommended with gadolinium to evaluate for the presence of residual tumor. This can be done as an outpatient with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 1338**]. Rehabilitation: The patient throughout this admission worked with our physical therapy people and continued to improve with regard to range of motion and strength in the upper and lower extremities, and by the time of discharge, she was ambulating throughout the [**Doctor Last Name **] and around the hospital without problems. She was therefore discharged home without need for Physical Therapy Services. At the time of discharge, the patient has markedly improved from her initial presentation and is to be discharged home with nursing assistance. DISCHARGE STATUS: Markedly improved. DISCHARGE DIAGNOSIS: 1. [**Doctor Last Name **]-[**Location (un) **] syndrome secondary to Dilantin. 2. Status post craniotomy on [**2109-7-1**], for a cystic cranial lesion, likely dysembryoplastic angioneural epithelial lesion with features consistent with an oligodendroglioma. DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS: Polysporin ophthalmology O.U. q.i.d., hydrated Petroleum as needed, Lipitor 10 mg p.o. q.d., Nystatin, Boost t.i.d. FOLLOW-UP: 1. Ophthalmology [**2109-8-20**], at 12:45 p.m. 2. Primary care physician in two weeks. 3. Dermatology as needed. DISCHARGE NOTE: PLEASE NOTE THAT THE PATIENT IS ALLERGIC TO DILANTIN AND TEGRETOL GIVEN HER [**Doctor Last Name **]-[**Location (un) **] SECONDARY TO DILANTIN. The patient is recommended to wear an alert bracelet which indicates this reaction.

        "Within the last several days, he has seen you in clinic and once again discussed whether or not to undergo radiation for his left temporal lesion. The patient has clearly been extremely ambivalent about this therapy for reasons that are not immediately apparent. It is clear that his MRI is progressing and that it seems unlikely at this time that anything other than radiation would be particularly effective. Despite repeatedly emphasizing this; however, the patient still is worried about potential long-term side effects from treatment that frankly seem unwarranted at this particular time.\n",
        "After seeing you in clinic, he and his friend again wanted to discuss possible changes in the chemotherapy regimen. They came in with a list of eight possible agents that they would like to be administered within the next two weeks. They then wanted another MRI to be performed and they were hoping that with the use of this type of approach, they might be able to induce another remission from which he can once again be spared radiation.\n",
        "From my view, I noticed a man whose language has deteriorated in the week since I last saw him. This is very worrisome. Today, for the first time, I felt that there was a definite right facial droop as well. Therefore, there is no doubt that he is becoming symptomatic from his growing tumor. It suggests that he is approaching the end of his compliance curve and that the things may rapidly deteriorate in the near future.\n",
        "Emphasizing this once again, in addition, to recommending steroids I once again tried to convince him to undergo radiation. Despite an hour, this again amazingly was not possible. It is not that he does not want treatment, however. Because I told him that I did not feel it was ethical to just put him on the radical regimen that him and his friend devised, we compromised and elected to go back to Temodar in a low dose daily type regimen. We would plan on giving 75 mg/sq m everyday for 21 days out of 28 days. In addition, we will stop thalidomide 100 mg/day. If he tolerates this for one week, we then agree that we would institute another one of the medications that he listed for us. At this stage, we are thinking of using Accutane at that point.\n",
        "While I am very uncomfortable with this type of approach, I think as long as he is going to be monitored closely that we may be able to get away with this for at least a reasonable interval. In the spirit of compromise, he again consented to be evaluated by radiation and this time, seemed more resigned to the fact that it was going to happen sooner than later. I will look at this as a positive sign because I think radiation is the one therapy from which he can get a reasonable response in the long term.\n",

epidural hematoma and LE weakness on [**2133-6-12**], Following diagnositic evaluation the patient was taken to surgery for a T12-L2 laminectomy and subsequent evacuation of the hematoma At the time of admission the patient's INR was 35 as she was taking 35mg coumadin PO Qhs for prophylactic anticoagulation due to her h/o afib and MVR Her coumadin was held and her INR monitored following surgery She was placed on coumadin 30mg Qhs once her INR dropped below 20 and she was bridged with a heparin drip Coumadin was increased to 40mg on [**2133-6-17**] and as her INR rose to 28 on [**6-22**] decreased to 30mg Subsequent to her INR dropping from 25 to 21 on [**6-25**] and then to 19 on [**6-26**] the coumadin dose was increased to 40mg and 50mg repectively Coumadin continued to be titrated to a dose of 35mg (her dose PTA) giving an INR of 24 at discharge In the perioperative period the patient began having episodes of bradycardia and pauses for which a single wire pacemaker was placed on [**2133-6-14**] with confirmation of proper lead placement by CXR, The PM was interrogated on [**2133-6-24**] and found to be functioning properly Additionally in this time she developed mild anemia likely due to the spontaneous hematoma and surgical blood loss for which she received a total of 2 units of PRBCs and has since resolved During this time the patient was continued on Lanoxin for her atrial fibrillation and developed a NSVT/?, junctional tachycardia likely due to digoxin toxicity Her digoxin was discontinued and per EP's recommendations was not restarted and will be held indefinitely In order to maintain K levels above 40 to avoid potential dysrhytmias from hypokalemia spironolactone 25mg PO daily was started On this regimen the patient required 40mEq of KCl PO daily to maintain her K levels and this was reduced to 20mEq daily as the K level on the day prior to discharge was 45 On discharge the K level was 43 For heartrate control metoprolol was increased over time to an eventual dose of 75mg PO BID the day prior to discharge during which time the patient's BP was stable at SBP=110s to 130s, On the day of discharge metoprolol, 75mg, [**Hospital1, **] was increased to Toprol XL 200mg to help control SBP that were in the upper 120s Following evacuation of her epidural hematoma she developed right LE pain which was attributed to a radiculpathy and was successfully treated with Neurontin 100mg TID Due to predominately left LE weakness PT was consulted and recommended that the pt be discharged to an extended care factility where she could receive further care from PT The patient continued to improve during the course of her stay but was it was still considered necessary that the pt receive rehab upon d/c Prior to discharge the patient was prescribed an AFO left foot splint, In addition she spiked a temperature to 1003 for which an infection work-up was began Urine Cx showed Proteus Mirabilis Bld Cx negative, She was treated impirically

history presents after being found unresponsive by family member, [**Name (NI) **] had prodrome of cold-like symptoms per report It is unclear what was the precipitant of the profound weakness / loss of consciousness but concern exists for cardiac etiology in addition to infection /, sepsis The patient was not \"down\" for long (likely << 24h) given absence of profound volume depletion minimal CK elevation, No evidence of trauma He was initially transferred to the ICU for treatment Hospital course is discussed by problem  ID - Blood cultures were drawn negative for growth Given the patient's low grade temperature elevation and leukocytosis as well as the history of \"cold-like\" symptoms experienced by patient pneumonia was thought to be the most likely source of infection An initial CXR demonstrated an early PNA consistent with aspiration so he was started on empiric coverage with vancomycin/levofloxacin/Flagyl, The patient went into respiratory distress secondary to sepsis/pneumonia and the patient required intubation He was later successfully extubated The patient rapidly improved and his lactate normalized His antibiotic coverage was narrowed to Levofloxacin only and finished a seven day course prior to discharge  CV - Possible arrhythmic impetus (VT less likely VF given period on floor) in setting of unknown history of vascular disease An EKG demonstrates LBBB which could be chronic and indicate significant CAD Given his NSTEMI with troponin up to >30 and an index of 8 cardiology was consulted for further recommendations Given that the patient was shocked hypotensive and septic; this may have all contributed to the troponin elevation He underwent an echocardiogram with report as follows 1 The left atrium is mildly dilated 2 There is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with normal cavity size Overall left ventricular systolic function is difficult to assess but is probably moderately depressed Overall left ventricular systolic function cannot be reliably assessed 3, The aortic root is mildly dilated 4 The aortic valve leaflets are severely thickened/deformed There is probably mild to moderate aortic valve stenosis 5, The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened There is moderate thickening of the mitral valve chordae At least mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is seen The mitral regurgitation jet is eccentric, [Due to acoustic shadowing the severity of mitral regurgitation may be significantly underestimated], He was started on a beta-blocker aspirin high dose Statin and an ACE inhibitor for medical management In addition a heparin drip was administered for 48 hours However a few hours after the second dose of Captopril the patient developed severe angioedema with lip and tongue swelling The patient was given Epi Benadryl IV steroids and ranitidine immediately and anesthesia was consulted for possible intubation as well as the ICU team The patient was transferred back to the ICU for airway monitoring but was able to be medically managed without intubation Allergy service was consulted and felt that this was consistent with an ACE-I allergy rather than a C-1 deficiency, The C-1 assay was sent to rule out deficiency with the results still pending at the time of discharge The patient's PCP was [**Name (NI) 653**] and a follow-up appointment with an outside cardiologist was arranged prior to discharge He was also started on Norvasc to help optimize his blood pressure control  Renal-, He was initially in acute renal failure with a creatinine of 18 on admission Although his baseline was unknown it resolved to 11 His Foley was discontinued and he urinated without difficulty A microalbumin was sent which was negative therefore initiating [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **], [**Last Name (un) **] was deferred by now According to the allergy service there is some risk of allergy with [**Last Name (un) **] although very low  Endocrine- Given that he had a history of \"borderline\" diabetes he was monitored with FS QID and covered with an ISS particularly in the setting of steroids for angioedema, A free T4 was normal and a urine for microalbumin shows alb/creatinine ratio 276  , Heme- He was found to have anemia normocytic hct since admission 33-38 then improved to 40 He was guaiac negative and iron studies were consistent with anemia of chronic disease  He was evaluated by PT and was cleared for a

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS, The patient is a 73-year-old woman who has a history of parastomal hernias and has had these hernias repaired times four or five She now presents with acute onset of abdominal distention nausea and vomiting as well as a mass in the parastomal region PAST, MEDICAL HISTORY ETOH (one bottle of wine per day), Hypertension Gastroesophageal reflux disease Hepatitis C

is in some distress Chest is clear to auscultation bilaterally Cardiovascular is regular rate and rhythm without murmur rub or gallop Abdomen is soft mildly distended and tender to palpation Tenderness is localized to the lower abdomen and more so in the parastomal region There is a large bulge around the ostomy Stoma itself is fairly pink and healthy Extremities are warm and well perfused with minimal edema HOSPITAL COURSE, The patient was admitted for repair of her incarcerated parastomal hernia She was taken to the Operating Room on [**2121-11-3**] for reduction as well as colostomy re-siting into the left upper quadrant For details of this please see the previously dictated operative note Postoperatively the patient's course was complicated by what was thought to be an aspiration event on the evening of postoperative day number two She had acute respiratory distress as well as change in mental status which is different from her baseline She was maintained with Lasix diuresis and face mask for approximately 8-12 hours but then was subsequently intubated and transferred to the Intensive Care Unit for worsening respiratory status She was initially only intubated for about 24 hours and met all criteria for extubation Chest x-ray did confirm that she had bilateral upper zone infiltrates and the patient was empirically treated with a seven day course of vancomycin and Levaquin After the patient met her respiratory extubation criteria she was extubated She continued to do fairly well but had change in mental status which could not be attributed to anything other than alcohol withdrawal TSH B-12 and folate levels were checked which were normal CT scan of the head was obtained on [**2121-11-10**] which did not show any evidence of acute injury There was some evidence of old lacunar infarcts MR of the head was completed on [**2121-11-12**] which confirmed the above In addition the Neurology service was consulted for her change in mental status and they felt it was best attributed also to her alcohol withdrawal as well as withdrawal from her Serax These were restarted per their recommendations and the patient gradually improved some of her mental status On [**2121-11-10**] the patient was re-intubated (postoperative day number seven) for worsening respiratory status She was maintained and ventilated during this time and had a bronchoscopy performed on [**2121-11-13**] which proved to be negative for any significant pluggings or other bronchial disease The patient was extubated later that day on [**2121-11-13**], but then quickly failed her extubation trial within approximately six hours She was emergently re- intubated and there was seen to be a fair amount of tracheal and laryngeal edema at that time The decision was then made to give the patient a surgical airway and percutaneous tracheostomy was performed on [**2121-11-14**], This was done in accordance and consent with her son who was the healthcare proxy during her change in mental status Ultimately the patient was discharged on postoperative day number fourteen to a [**Hospital 4820**] rehabilitation facility for ventilatory weaning as well as allowing clearance of her mental status The Neurology service had seen the patient on the day of discharge and agreed with the above and to continue present management, The patient had a post-pyloric feeding tube placed in Interventional Radiology on the day of discharge in order to decrease the risk of aspiration pneumonia The patient was tolerating tube feeds adequate and had good function with occasional tracheostomy mask trials from the vent DISPOSITION To [**Hospital 4820**], rehabilitation facility DIET, Tube feedings Impact with fiber (or other immunogenic tube feed formulation) at 75 cc/hr DISCHARGE

is a 54-year-old female who had a total knee repair 2 weeks ago and subsequently developed heparin induced thrombocytopenia with a large right iliofemoral DVT and over the past 3 days Progressive signs of phlegmasia cerulea dolens Despite aggressive anticoagulation with direct thrombin inhibitors and elevation the toes were progressively gangrenous and venous thrombectomy was required to prevent limb loss She was not a candidate for thrombolysis due to her recent knee replacement Patient was admitted and placed on argatroban for anticoagulation and diltiazem Patient was transfused 2units, x2 for low hct Patient was taken to the OR venous thrombectomy to salvage limb In the OR the patient was found to have a patent left iliac venous system and patent inferior vena cava Uneventful deployment of a Tulip IVC filter Successful thrombectomy of the femoral vein of the thigh and profunda veins along with large amount of thrombus removed from the right iliac system The resultant clearing was quite good AV fistula was placed from the branch of the anterior saphenous vein to the superficial femoral artery Patient tolerated the procedure well and was transferred in

of Present Illness This is a 39 yo male who was working on a construction site and was witnessed to fall from a standing position and lose consciousness He was also reported to have ?, seizure activity Bystanders found him to be unresponsive/pulseless and initiated CPR for 10 minutes EMS arrived and found him to be in VF arrest which was converted to sinus with 1 shock He was intubated on the field and transferred to [**Hospital6, **] On arrival he was unresponsive; and shortly went into PEA arrest and was ?shocked?, x 1 with resolution to sinus tach with LBBB  , He was taken to the cath lab which showed 100% RCA and 100% LCx; LAD 20% lesion which appeared \"chronic\"; EF 15% When they tried to cross 1 lesion his HR increased to 180's ?VT; he was shocked with 200J x, [**Street

noted again to have seizure-like activity (unsure of character) and was given 10mg ativan and taken to CT scan which was preliminarily read as negative (although on review here may be c/w

extra-axial hemorrhage  , The findings were discussed with Dr, [**First Name (STitle) **], [**Name (STitle) 1255**], [**Doctor Last Name **] at 940 pm on [**2119-2-8**] The outside hospital CT scan was obtained on hard copy and will be brought to the file room in the morning Review of that examination at the time of attending review does show increased density of the tentorium which presumably relates to the large volume of IV contrast used for what apparently was a cardiac catheterization at that facility which also resulted in visualization of the vascular tributaries of the circle of [**Location (un) 431**] on this [**Hospital3 **] CT scan This tentorial enhancement is no longer seen likely due to the renal excretion of the contrast, [**Doctor Last Name 360**]  , [**2119-2-8**] CXR 1 Successful intubation 2 Diffuse bilateral hazy ground-glass opacities This is nonspecific and may represent diverse etiologies depending on the patient's clinical situation eg aspiration hemorrhage or PCP if the patient is immunocompromised Followup is recommended  [**2119-2-10**], CXR Since the prior chest x-ray the endotracheal tube and nasogastric tube have been removed There has been no significant change since the prior film of six hours previous The cardiomegaly effusions and some edema are still present  IMPRESSION Cardiac failure persists  [**2119-2-10**] EKG Sinus rhythm Left axis deviation Left bundle-branch block Compared to the previous tracing sinus rhythm is now present Brief Hospital Course #) VF arrest/rhythm Most likely a primary arrthymic event (based on story of falling pulseless with CPR for 10min and Vfib when EMS arrived) and secondary to ischemic scar from old infacts Does not appear to be ACS (low level CE stenosis on cath appeared old) ECGs during hospitalization showed sinus rhythm/sinus tach with LBBB (no old ECGs for comparison), He was loaded with amiodarone and maintained on metoprolol for rate control He was monitored on telemetry and had no further Vfib events; rhythm strips obtained from EMS and the outside hospital did not capture any v-fib events He had an ICD implanted on [**2119-2-17**] and tolerated the procedure, well He will follow up in device clinic on [**2119-3-1**]  #) CAD/Ischaemia He was taken for cardiac catheterization and was found to have RCA and LCx occlusion which was thought to be likely chronic CE's were trended and peaked at low level (likely related to post-code and not consistent with ACS), He was continued on aspirin and was titrated up on metoprolol, A statin was not started right away given his elevated LFTs but once these normalized he was started on a reduced-dose statin (20mg atorvastatin)  #), Pump Cath report showed an EF 15%; Multifactorial; ?acute post code shock ischemic cardiomyopathy ?, alcoholic cardiomyopathy, Hopefully he will recover some function, A repeat echo showed an EF of 20-25% with no major valvular abnormalities He will need another echo in approximately one month to assess for recovery of his systolic function  # fevers He spiked fevers up to 102, He was initially started on levo/metronidazole and vanco before a known source was found to cover for likely aspiration pneumonia and line infections He was then found to have strep pneumo in his sputum and continued to spike fevers until he was stabilized on an antibiotic regimen of ceftriaxone/azithromycin, There was also concern that these fevers might be related to alcohol withdrawl and/or drug fever (from phenytoin which was stopped on [**2-13**]), He completed a five day course of azithromycin and his ceftriaxone will be converted to cefpodoxime to complete a 10-day course  #) Altered mental status/EtOH withdrawl This has a multifactorial origin VF arrest EtOH sedation now Per his sister (whom he lives with) that he drank about [**1-20**] vodka per night for 4 months and then stopped abruptly ~4 days prior to admission Neurology was consulted especially given question of seizure activity at the OSH, An EEG was negative for seizures and an LP showed normal cell count protein and glucose with no evidence of infection A psychiatry consultation was obtained and they believed that his prolonged delirium may have been benzodiazepine intoxication He was maintained on standing Haldol and only short-acting benzo's (lorazepam) were used for his CIWA scale and his mental status gradually improved He worked with PT/OT to regain strength balance and functioning prior to discharge  #) Transaminitis Patient has mildly elevated alt > ast GGT mildly elevated as well Most likely secondary to mild shock liver in setting of code Underlying liver disease from h/o recent heavy EtOH use high triglycerides (150) could put him at risk for more damage His acetaminophen use was limited to 2g/day and he was eventually started on a reduced dose of atorvastatin for his hyperlipidemia  #) Elevated Cr Initially had some ARF which was most-likely ATN/hypoperfusion from cardiac arrest He was hydrated and received mucomyst for cath, His Cr trended down and recovered  #) FEN/, GI He was given protonix for GI ppx given alcohol use He was also ordered for a speech and swallow eval after extubation given his still \"cloudy\" mental status to assess risk for aspiration He eventually passed a speech and swallow study though was recommeded to

low-grade temp who was initially admitted to the MICU for hypotension and ARF improved after volume resuscitation  # Diarrhea Likely the patient was hypotensive and in renal failure secondary to hypovolemia precipitating, ARF, The patient had a small amount of outpatient work-up for this negative to date including Stool C Diff culture and CMV viral load undetectable, The patient was given symptomatic treatment including imodium and his diarrhea improved dramatically He was unable to provide a stool sample while on the floor, The patient was given a prescription for an outpatient stool sample for repeat stool culture (including viral and bacterial) DFA for crytosporidium and giardia ova & parasites microsporidium The GI team was consulted on the patient It was their recommendation that the patient have an infectious work-up If negative and diarrhea persists the patient should have a colonoscopy at a later date when aspirin and plavix can be held (at least 9 months from the time of drug eluting stent placement At the time of discharge the patient's diarrhea was well-controlled with loperamide and the patient was tolerating fluids, PO He was encouraged to have aggressive PO fluid intake whenever diarrhea occurs  # Fevers, The patient had a low-grade (100) fever after coming to the floor from the MICU This may be secondary to the same process as the diarrhea, However the patient has poorly controlled HIV and therefore is at risk for numerous sources Empiric antibiotics were deferred as no source of infection was found  # Hypotension Likely secondary to persistent diarrhea The patient was aggressively hydrated with IV NS in the MICU He came to the floor normotensive and maintained this volume status for the remainder of his time in the hospital  # Acute renal failure Likely pre-renal secondary to persistent diarrhea and volume depletion, The patient's Cr improved to normal range after volume resuscitation  # Chest pain, The patient had a CTA that was negative for PE He had a slight troponin elevation thought consistent with demand ischemia in the setting of hypotension and poor troponin excretion in the setting of renal failure The patient's

[**2200-2-15**], Over the three-day interval there has been little change in the overall appearance of the heterogeneous but predominantly hyperattenuating lobulated process centered in the extra-axial space of the left parietovertex This appears to \"mold\" to the contour of the subjacent convexity where there is focal low-attenuation in the immediate subcortical white matter corresponding to the FLAIR-signal abnormality in this region which may represent edema secondary to venous congestion gliosis or both The overall appearance is most suggestive of a partially calcified en plaque meningioma though there is no specific evidence of \"reactive change\" in the suprajacent inner table of the skull There has been no other short-interval change IMPRESSION, No short-interval change in the overall appearance with the lobulated predominantly hyperdense process in the extra-axial space at the left parietovertex given its stability and MR [**Date Range **] more likely an en plaque meningioma partially calcified accounting for the MR [**First Name (Titles) 16313**], [**Last Name (Titles) **], Moreover the findings on both this exam and the recent enhanced MR study raise the serious possibility of at least partial invasion of the immediately subjacent superior sagittal sinus without definite thrombosis and possible venous obstruction-related edema in local white matter If this will affect therapeutic decision dedicated MR, [**First Name (Titles) **], [**Last Name (Titles) **] venography might be considered MRI Brain, [**2200-2-15**] FINDINGS, The study is significantly limited due to patient motion artifacts There is enhancement noted in the area of known hemorrhage in the left parieto- occipital region compared to the pre-contrast sequences done on the prior study However the etiology of enhancement is not clear as there is significant amount of hemorrhage in this location as seen on the prior CT and MR studies Mildly dilated ventricles are visualized, not adequately assessed IMPRESSION 1 Study significantly limited due to motion artifacts Enhancement noted in the left parieto-occipital region partly extending along the dura the etiology of which is uncertain as this is in the region of the known hemorrhage Repeat evaluation after resolution of the hemorrhage can be considered to evaluate for any underlying vascular or space-occupying lesion Close followup with CT scan can also be considered as, clinically indicated Brief Hospital Course, The patient was admitted on [**2200-2-14**] to the neurosurgery service after a mental status change at the nursing home He was admitted with a presumed SDH on the CT scan However the patient had an MRI which revealed a mass resembling a meningioma There was no hemorrhage there The patient was transferred out of the ICU on [**2200-2-18**], He was evaluated by PT and a speech/swallowing therapist PT felt that he was safe to be discharged back the his nursing home on [**2200-2-19**], On [**2-19**] he was also able to take in thin liquids and pureed solids without difficulty He had his foley catheter removed on [**2-18**] but had urinary retention A Coud??????, catheter was placed that night and he was discharged with it in place Flomax was started as well and bladder training was begun He may be able to have it removed in a day or so at the nursing home, The patient should follow up with a urologist The patient was made DNR/DNI in the hospital by his health care proxy as well as for the ambulance ride Palliative care and medical consults were obtained to assist in management of the patient, His medications were optimized due to his mental status changes Additionally a family meeting with all 3 teams occurred It was felt that surgery would not benefit the

sudden onset left sided weakness On her exam her NIHSS is 17 and she has a dense left sided hemiparesis as well as right gaze deviation left hemianopia and neglect Her imaging shows an occlusion of R MCA near its origin Her history exam and imaging are consistent with acute embolic stroke in R MCA, The time of onset was taken to be 0130; the time of her thrashing and so when she was seen here she remained within the window for IV tPA, The decision was made to proceed with the IV tPA, The plan at this time is to proceed with tPA infusion and if clinical exam remains unchanged in 30 minutes then plan is to proceed with angio for IA tPA vs Merci Neuro, Ms [**Known lastname 104742**] was admitted to the neurology ICU attending Dr, [**Last Name (STitle) **], There was no improvement with tPA and she developed hematomas of the right knee left scalp and left clavicular area so IV TPA was stopped The team proceeded with angio and MERCI device was used This resulted in opening of inferior division of the right MCA but opening of the superior division was unsuccessful, She was monitored in the ICU and then was transferred to the step down unit then to the floor for further management She was started on Aspirin 81mg and Lovenox 40mg daily (given possible MDS/malignancy), Her CT scans showed hemorrhagic conversion in the Right striatum and white matter An MRI was attempted but she was unable to tolerate this There was no need to attempt repeating this MRI per Dr, [**First Name (STitle) **] stroke attending Imaging otherwise as above CVR Blood pressure was controlled metoprolol 25mg TID and as needed hydralazine, Her metoprolol was increased to 50mg TID prior to discharge She had an transthoracic echocardiogram which showed no ASD or LV thrombus There was normal global and regional biventricular systolic function There was mild pulmonary hypertension, A bubble study was not done A transesophageal echocardiogram was attempted however, Ms [**Known lastname 104742**] developed methemoglobinemia (level 29) after receiving benzocaine spray She received Methylene blue 140mg IV by anesthesia and had rapid clinical improvement Her methemoglobinemia level was zero before returning to the neurology floor A transthoracic echo with bubble was later done which showed No atrial septal defect or patent foramen ovale is seen by 2D color Doppler or saline contrast with maneuvers She had lower extremity doppler studies which were negative for DVT Hypercoagulable work up is pending at the time of discharge antithrombin 3 prothrombin gene mutation factor v leiden, Heme Due to her myelodysplastic syndrome and bleeding with tPA heme-onc was consulted and they did not believe there were any restrictions on her stroke management due to her MDS, Additionally the team spoke with her outpatient hematologist who confirmed no need for epo or aranesp while in the hospital, Her HCT was stable during her hospitalization, FEN/GI She was initially NPO, She was followed closely by speech and language team and was started on NGT feeds When able a regular diet was initiated and advanced At the time of discharge she was tolerating a regular diet with nectar-thick liquids Her electrolytes were monitored carefully and repleted as necessary She received Famotidine for GI prophylaxis Psych/ETOH Initially Ms, [**Known lastname 104742**] had significant alcohol

subsequent pathology demonstrated clotted blood He was kept in the neurosurgical ICU for two days where he did well with no post-operative complications and was then sent back to the bone marrow unit for further care By his return to BMT his speech and confusion had greatly improved and his family members agreed that he was back to his baseline Throughout the remainder of the admission he continued to experience a slight headache much improved from admission that was well relieved by 5mg of oxycodone His word-finding symptoms did not recur The main challenge was maintaining his platelets at a an appropriate level due to his underlying myelodysplastic syndrome Per the neurosurgery team his goal for platelets was around 50 for three weeks; at the time of discharge he will require an additional week of platelets at this level usually achievable by giving two bags of platelets each morning checking a post transfusion count 30-60 minutes thereafter After this week has finished he will be maintained at his prior level getting transfusion two to three times per week at [**Hospital1 1388**] hematology clinic under the care of Dr, [**First Name (STitle) 1557**], He will follow-up with his hematologist, Dr, [**First Name (STitle) 1557**] for his AML in one week and with Dr, [**Last Name (STitle) 739**] a neurosurgeon in two weeks (he will get a repeat CT scan at that time) 2)AML --, Mr [**Known lastname **] is being treated with hydroxyurea and transfusions as needed His WBC at [**Hospital1 18**] ranged between 12 and 28 generally around 14, His goal hematocrit was over 25 and he generally required one unit of packed RBC's every three to four days Platelet requirements have been described above 3)Type two diabetes -- The prednisone, Mr [**Known lastname, **] takes makes his blood sugars somewhat difficult to control however a regimen of Humalog 75/25 with 45 units every morning and 25 units at night seemed to work the best He was also covered with a routine regular insulin sliding scale for excessively high values (usually starting at 2 units of regular insulin for a glucose of 150-200 and going up by two units of insulin for every 50mg/dl of blood glucose increase) 4)COPD --, Mr, [**Known lastname **] was maintained on Advair 250/50 one puff twice a day He was also given an albuterol inhaler for shortness of breath/wheezing that he rarely needed He became wheezier in the middle of the admission and was given twice daily scheduled albuterol nebs to which he responded well We would recommend continuing these for two more days then stopping them leaving him on only Advair and as needed albuterol inhalers 5)Fever -- One week prior to discharge, Mr [**Known lastname **] had a temperature to 101 His blood and urine cultures were negative Clinically and radiographically his most likely source was pulmonary although the chest x-ray did not demonstrate an obvious pneumonia He was treated with levofloxacin and will finish his course with seven more days of antibiotics Medications on Admission Humalog 75/25 40 units sc every AM and, PM Furosemide 20mg po daily Advair 250/50 one puff twice daily Hydroxyurea 1000mg po once daily Pantoprazole 40mg po daily Prednisone 15mg po daily Discharge Medications 1 Humalog Mix 75-25 75-25 unit/mL Suspension Sig Forty Five (45) Units Subcutaneous qAM 2 Albuterol Sulfate, 0083 % Solution Sig One (1) Neb Inhalation twice a day Disp*qs qs* Refills*2* 3 Fexofenadine HCl 60 mg Capsule Sig One (1) Capsule PO BID (2 times a day) 4 Levofloxacin 500 mg Tablet Sig One (1) Tablet PO Q24H (every 24 hours) for 7 days 5 Furosemide 20 mg Tablet Sig One (1) Tablet PO DAILY (Daily) 6 Fluticasone-Salmeterol 250-50 mcg/Dose Disk with Device Sig One (, 1) Puff, Inhalation, [**Hospital1 *, *] (2 times a day) 7 Hydroxyurea 500 mg Capsule Sig Two (2) Capsule PO DAILY (Daily) 8 Pantoprazole Sodium 40 mg Tablet Delayed Release (EC) Sig One (1) Tablet Delayed Release (EC) PO Q24H (every 24 hours) 9 Docusate Sodium 100 mg Capsule Sig One (1) Capsule PO BID (2 times a day) 10 Oxycodone HCl 5 mg Tablet Sig One (1) Tablet PO Q4-6H (every 4 to 6 hours) as needed 11 Prednisone 10 mg Tablet Sig One (1) Tablet PO DAILY (Daily) 12 Senna 86 mg Tablet Sig One (1) Tablet PO DAILY (Daily) 13 Heparin Lock Flush (Porcine) 100 unit/mL Syringe Sig Two (2) Ml Intravenous DAILY (Daily) as needed Ml 14 Humalog Mix 75-25 75-25 unit/mL Suspension Sig Twenty (20) Units Subcutaneous qPM, Discharge Disposition Extended Care Facility, [**Hospital1 700**] -, [**Location (un) 701**] Discharge Diagnosis Primary Subdural hematomoa Secondary Acute Myelogenous leukemia/Myelodysplastic syndrome Diabetes -- type two COPD Discharge Condition Fair with improved sx stable hematoma requiring frequent platelet transfusions Discharge Instructions Please return to the emergency department for fevers/chills shortness of breath chest pain severe headaches confusion speech difficulties Follow up as below Take medications as prescribed Followup Instructions You have an appointment with Dr, [**Last Name (STitle) **] on [**11-19**] at 1130 Please call [**Telephone/Fax (1) 107363**] for questions Provider [**First Name11 (Name Pattern1) 1730**], [**Last Name (NamePattern4) 6175**] MD, Where [**Hospital6 29**] HEMATOLOGY/BMT Phone[**Telephone/Fax (1) 3237**] Date/Time[**2184-11-15**] 1230 Please call Dr, [**Last Name (STitle) 739**] your neurosurgeon at [**Telephone/Fax (1) 1669**] to be seen in two weeks When you call please remind them you will need another CT-scan of your head prior to the visit  Drug_1 PO Drug_2 Pantoprazole Sodium]\n"

atypical infection with hypotension that is suspected to be hypovolemia or adrenal insufficiency with acute renal failure  # Lethargy concern for viral syndrome including activation of CMV or a respiratory virus He has been known EBV+ in the past This could also be related to sensation of dyspnea that he has been having and warranted further cardiovascular and pulmonary work-up in parallel

fungal markers blood cultures urine cultures CT chest Pt's lethargy improved with IVFs antibiotics and stress dose steroids Did not ever need pressors  # Dyspnea/Cough Concern for infectious process

low-grade temp who was initially admitted to the MICU for hypotension and ARF improved after volume resuscitation  # Diarrhea Likely the patient was hypotensive and in renal failure secondary to hypovolemia precipitating, ARF, The patient had a small amount of outpatient work-up for this negative to date including Stool C Diff culture and CMV viral load undetectable, The patient was given symptomatic treatment including imodium and his diarrhea improved dramatically He was unable to provide a stool sample while on the floor, The patient was given a prescription for an outpatient stool sample for repeat stool culture (including viral and bacterial) DFA for crytosporidium and giardia ova & parasites microsporidium The GI team was consulted on the patient It was their recommendation that the patient have an infectious work-up If negative and diarrhea persists the patient should have a colonoscopy at a later date when aspirin and plavix can be held (at least 9 months from the time of drug eluting stent placement At the time of discharge the patient's diarrhea was well-controlled with loperamide and the patient was tolerating fluids, PO He was encouraged to have aggressive PO fluid intake whenever diarrhea occurs  # Fevers, The patient had a low-grade (100) fever after coming to the floor from the MICU This may be secondary to the same process as the diarrhea, However the patient has poorly controlled HIV and therefore is at risk for numerous sources Empiric antibiotics were deferred as no source of infection was found  # Hypotension Likely secondary to persistent diarrhea The patient was aggressively hydrated with IV NS in the MICU He came to the floor normotensive and maintained this volume status for the remainder of his time in the hospital  # Acute renal failure Likely pre-renal secondary to persistent diarrhea and volume depletion, The patient's Cr improved to normal range after volume resuscitation  # Chest pain, The patient had a CTA that was negative for PE He had a slight troponin elevation thought consistent with demand ischemia in the setting of hypotension and poor troponin excretion in the setting of renal failure The patient's troponin trended downward throughout his admission and he never showed CK elevations  #, CAD, No signs of acute ischemia Troponin leak with normal CK likely secondary to demand ischemia and, ARF, The patient was continued on ASA plavix beta blocker statin His ACEi was held for renal failure and then restarted prior to discharge On echo the patient had new mechanical dysfunction The patient should have outpatient p-MIBI to assess for perfusion deficits  # HIV On [**2192-9-11**], CD4 72 VL>100000, The patient's HAART has been held while in the MICU for renal failure These medications were restarted prior to discharge The patient's PCP will consider initiating prophylactic antibiotics as an outpatient  # Anemia Patient's baseline appears 29-30 Patient with drop in Hct likely in part secondary to dilution, The patient had guaiac positive stool with known abnormal colonoscopy and EGD in past is concerning for GI bleed The patient had multiple units of blood transfusion while in the MICU His Hct normalized prior to discharge  # Thrombocytopenia The patient's platelets declined to 90 while in the MICU and he was found to be HIT antibody positive Heparin products were held and the

yo Cantonse speaking female who presented with letargy gait abnormality and a serum sodium of 104, In ED she was found to have obstructive uropathy resolving with foley placement, Of note she has been of HCTZ/Triamtrene for number of years as treatment of her HTN 1 Hyponatremia Pt with profound hyponatremia thought likely secondary to her diuretic use In the ED she appeared dry on exam, The patient had an initial FeNa of 491 and a urine, Na of 26 which was consistent with renal losses and inconsistent with SIADH In the ED she received one liter of normal saline and her sodium increased from the nadir of 104 to 121 by the time of arrival to the ICU She was not given any more saline at that time and her sodium was monitored while tolerating a regular diet It slowly increased to 127 she was noted to have global hyporeflexia but no other neurological deficits at time of transfer to the floors Pt was monitored and all IVFs were held as her sodium level slowly increased to normal on HD#5, It was thought that her neurogenic bladder caused a decrease in GFR and a build of thiazide diuretic which led to her severe hyponatremia Once a Foley was placed in the [**Name (NI) **] pt was able to urinate and auto-correct and her sodium drifted to normal with minimal intervention, No neurologic sequelae was seen due to the correction of her sodium during this admission Pt was instructed at discharge to never restart her thiazide diuretic as this alone may have precipitated her severe hyponatremia  2 Urine outflow obstruction It remained unclear what caused her initial neurogenic bladder and bladder residual of 1700cc at time of admission It was thought that perhaps a medication effect whether OTC medication or anticholinergic benadryl in cough syrup that perhaps contributed to her neurogenic bladder Pt was attempted multiple voiding trials on HD#5 and HD#7 but each time patient had PVR of >700cc and the Foley was reinserted Urology was consulted who recommended leaving the

In all other respects the radiographic appearance of these severely scarred and bronchiectatic lungs as well as bilateral pleural abnormalities are unchanged over the long-term There are no findings to suggest acute pneumonia or pulmonary edema Brief Hospital Course 76 yo male with end stage sarcoidosis presenting with dyspnea  # HYPERCARBIC RESPIRATORY FAILURE Pt presented to the ER with increased shortness of breath over 24hrs tachycardia and generalized fatigue Similar prior presentations were felt to be related to sarcoid flares CXR showed end stage pulmonary fibrosis but no other abnormalities It was felt his sx likely represented pneumonia in setting of severe underlying fibrotic lung disease Pt was unable to sustain high minute ventilatory rate evidenced by a rising pCO2 and thus required emergent intubation shortly after arrival to ICU The patient was treated for presumed pneumonia with levofloxacin and meropenem given leukocytosis and dyspnea Infectious work-up including multiple blood cultures and viral cultures were negative, The patient was not given steroids since it was felt that his sx were related to an infectious process rather than a flair of his sarcoid lung disease, The patient was made DNR after talking with the son IP consult was sought for trach placement given the patient's inability to wean off the ventilator with subsequent placement of tracheostomy and PEG on [**1-26**], and [**1-27**] respectively Pt tolerated trach mask well He was transferred to the floor on [**2-3**], Later that afternoon he was noted to desat into the 50's with increased work of breathing and was requiring high levels of nursing care He was transferred back to the MICU where he again experienced agitation and increased work of breathing He was placed back on the vent on PS overnight and tolerated this well and eventually was able to transition to trach mask throughtout the day and night Clinical decompensation attributed to mucus, plugging #, CHRONIC, ORTHOSTATIC HYPOTENSION Pt normotensive on admission to ICU His home medications of midodrine and fludricortisone were continued while admitted # Agitation, The patient had issues with agitation especially at night Geriatrics was consulted and a regimen of Seroquel was initiated as well as efforts to limit lines and to orient him frequently His mental status waxed and waned and he fell out of bed twice but sustained no injuries By [**2-1**] his delirium had improved on a regimen of seroquel to 125, mg, [**Hospital1, **] seroquel 25 mg QHS and Seroquel 25mg prn Upon readmission to the MICU however he again became significantly agitated and required IV haldol in addition to his scheduled seroquel EKG the following morning did not show any eveidence of prolonged QT Per geriatric recommendations the pt's seroquel was increased to 50mg qhs and his sundowning improved QTc was noted to 419 on discharge dose of seroquel  , The patient was on SubQ heparin for DVT

(hypoperfusion) from SIRS in setting of pneumonia or cardiogenic shock from ACS versus type B lactic acidosis from metformin/diabetes or active malignancy No evidence of liver mets or decreased synthetic function to suggest inability to clear lactate, While in the ICU the patient's metformin was held venous lactate levels and anion gap were followed He received maintenence fluids His lactate was downtrending on transfer to the floor  # Chest pain/CAD Low suspicion for ACS given ECG in ED unchanged without ST-T wave abnormalities CTA negative for PE and patient was CP free throughout his

and the patient required intubation He was later successfully extubated The patient rapidly improved and his lactate normalized His antibiotic coverage was narrowed to Levofloxacin only and finished a seven day course prior to discharge  CV - Possible arrhythmic impetus (VT less likely VF given period on floor) in setting of unknown history of vascular disease An EKG demonstrates LBBB which could be chronic and indicate significant CAD Given his NSTEMI with troponin up to >30 and an index of 8 cardiology was consulted for further recommendations Given that the patient was shocked hypotensive and septic; this may have all contributed to the troponin elevation He underwent an echocardiogram with report as follows 1 The left atrium is mildly dilated 2 There is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with normal cavity size Overall left ventricular systolic function is difficult to assess but is probably moderately depressed Overall left ventricular systolic function cannot be reliably assessed 3, The aortic root is mildly dilated 4 The aortic valve leaflets are severely thickened/deformed There is probably mild to moderate aortic valve stenosis 5, The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened There is moderate thickening of the mitral valve chordae At least mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is seen The mitral regurgitation jet is eccentric, [Due to acoustic shadowing the severity of mitral regurgitation may be significantly underestimated], He was started on a beta-blocker aspirin high dose Statin and an ACE inhibitor for medical management In addition a heparin drip was administered for 48 hours However a few hours after the second dose of Captopril the patient developed severe angioedema with lip and tongue swelling The patient was given Epi Benadryl IV steroids and ranitidine immediately and anesthesia was consulted for possible intubation as well as the ICU team The patient was transferred back to the ICU for airway monitoring but was able to be medically managed without intubation Allergy service was consulted and felt that this was consistent with an ACE-I allergy rather than a C-1 deficiency, The C-1 assay was sent to rule out deficiency with the results still pending at the time of discharge The patient's PCP was [**Name (NI) 653**] and a follow-up appointment with an outside cardiologist was arranged prior to discharge He was also started on Norvasc to help optimize his blood pressure control  Renal-, He was initially in acute renal failure with a creatinine of 18 on admission Although his baseline was unknown it resolved to 11 His Foley was discontinued and he urinated without difficulty A microalbumin was sent which was negative therefore initiating [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **], [**Last Name (un) **] was deferred by now According to the allergy service there is some risk of allergy with [**Last Name (un) **] although very low  Endocrine- Given that he had a history of \"borderline\" diabetes he was monitored with FS QID and covered with an ISS particularly in the setting of steroids for angioedema, A free T4 was normal and a urine for microalbumin shows alb/creatinine ratio 276  , Heme- He was found to have anemia normocytic hct since admission 33-38 then improved to 40 He was guaiac negative and iron studies were consistent with anemia of chronic disease  He was evaluated by PT and was cleared for a

cavity is unusually small Overall left ventricular systolic function is normal (LVEF 70%), Tissue Doppler imaging suggests an increased left ventricular filling pressure (PCWP>18mmHg) Transmitral Doppler and tissue velocity imaging are consistent with Grade III/IV (severe) LV diastolic dysfunction Right ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are normal There are focal calcifications in the aortic arch, The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is not present No aortic regurgitation is seen The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened There is no mitral valve prolapse There is severe mitral annular calcification There is moderate thickening of the mitral valve chordae AT LEAST moderate (2+) mitral regurgitation is seen, [Due to acoustic shadowing the severity of mitral regurgitation may be significantly UNDERestimated] The left ventricular inflow pattern suggests a restrictive filling abnormality with elevated left atrial pressure The tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly thickened, The supporting structures of the tricuspid valve are thickened/fibrotic Moderate, [2+] tricuspid regurgitation is seen There is mild pulmonary artery systolic hypertension There is no pericardial effusion IMPRESSION severe asymmetric left ventricular hypertrophy; small left ventricular cavity; severe left ventricular diastolic dysfunction;, at least moderate (and probably significantly more) mitral regurgitation, [**9-9**] CT abd/pelvis with IV contrast CT OF THE ABDOMEN WITH IV CONTRAST A left pleural effusion with associated atelectasis is stable The lung bases are otherwise clear, The liver gallbladder spleen adrenal glands and kidneys appear unremarkable Note is again made of a small right renal hypodensity measuring 6 mm likely representing a renal cyst There is evidence of periportal edema and anasarca A large left retroperitoneal hematoma now measures 8 (transverse) x 7 (AP) x 13 (coronal) cm and allowing for measurement differences has not changed in size compared to the prior study in terms of size No areas of active extravasation are noted on the arterial phase imaging and the density of the retroperitoneal hematoma does not increase with delayed imaging, No new hemorrhage is identified The abdominal portions of the large and small bowel are unremarkable Heavy calcification of the abdominal aorta is noted and a focal area of stenosis at the level of the pancreas is additionally noted CT OF THE PELVIS WITH IV CONTRAST Evaluation of the pelvis is limited secondary to streak artifact from left hip prosthesis A Foley balloon is present within the bladder The rectum and sigmoid colon are grossly unremarkable IMPRESSION Large left retroperitoneal hematoma essentially unchanged in size compared to the examination of nine hours prior No CT evidence of active extravasation Brief Hospital Course ACUTE ON CHRONIC LUMBOSACRAL RADICULOPATHY, Despite multimodality pain regimen the patient's pain remained poorly controlled except when treated with ketorolac, Unfortunately this is a potentially dangerous medication in this woman with advanced age mildly reduced renal function and on warfarin and plavix A pain consult was obtained, but they did not add much to the present management MRI of LS spine showed no evidence of nerve root impingement cauda equina or canal stenosis but incidental note was made of a possible left pelvic mass, This was further evaluated by CT It is possible that some of the pain and weakness may be related to an iliopsoas process  ACUTE RENAL FAILURE related to

treatment for hypoxia and neurologic evaluation 1 Upper GI Bleed PUD, likely [**3-7**] NSAIDs Pt was continued on PPI initially IV and transitioned to oral Her hematocrit was monitored twice daily initially and then daily All NSAIDS and Actonel were held with a recommendation to continue to avoid these medications after discharge Gastrin level was elevated but believed secondary to PPI therapy Pt will require outpatient GI follow-up Finally concern regarding the level of insight underlying the patient's large doses of NSAIDs coupled with her family's concerns about her psychiatric history prompted psychiatric and neurologic evaluations Both of these services followed the patient through her admission 2) Question of cholescystitis RUQ U/S for ?, sludge and GB wall thickening on CT U/S

Neuro/Pyschiatric Patient on Fluoxetine clonazepam and Anafranil at home which were originally held in the ICU Psychiatry consult was called after discussion with the patient's sister who was concerned about her inability to work and general lack of ability to care for herself most clearly manifested financially The psychiartry consult had no medication recommendations and her TSH/B12/Folate/RPR were all negative or within normal limits as appropriate They suspected a cognitive problem and were concerned by her lack of judgement however and also recommended an MRI The read of this MRI was notable for multiple T2 high-signal-intensity abnormalities in the periventricular white matter and, centrum semiovale The findings suggested a demyelinating disorder or potentially a microvascular angiopathy There was also an area of abnormality in the left periatrial white matter which could represent one of these demyelinating areas or could represent a small subacute infarct, The neurology team recommended an LP for routine analysis oligoclonal bands and ACE level to evaluate for multiple sclerosis and sarcoidosis; [**Doctor First Name **] ANCA CRP and ESR levels to evaluate for vasculitis; formal neuropsych evaluation as an outpatient and follow-up in behavioral neurology clinic The LP was performed prior to discharge and the bulk of the serologic testing was

respiratory virus He has been known EBV+ in the past This could also be related to sensation of dyspnea that he has been having and warranted further cardiovascular and pulmonary work-up in parallel

fungal markers blood cultures urine cultures CT chest Pt's lethargy improved with IVFs antibiotics and stress dose steroids Did not ever need pressors  # Dyspnea/Cough Concern for infectious process

RLE at the level of the ankle/mid tibia as well as two lacerations on the LUE each approx 5-6cm Orthopedics and Plastic Surgery were consulted to the trauma bay for management of these two injuries respectively He required one unit pRBCs during his resuscitation The patient did still have a dopplerable pulse in the RLE and was taken immediately to the OR for preliminary stabilization of the

management He was progressing well with an open right tib fib injury that had already been stabilized but continued to have unstable hematocrits requiring multiple additional transfusions No source outside of the RLE could be identified so the bleeding was assumed to be from his lower extremity injuries During the patients recovery on the floor he developed acute mental status changes  A head CT was obtained with no acute changes He was given Haldol for agitation and acutely developed fever to 103F, A diagnosis of Neuroleptic Malignant Syndrome was presumed and he was transferred to the SICU

with hypothermia temperature 32C, She was initially admitted to the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] where she was warmed up to euthermia and subsequently transferred to the floor Surveillance for infections was negative Psychiatry was consulted to assess for possible medication related symptoms A swollen lower lip and swollen tongue and shortness of breath prompted an eval by ENT to r/o vocal cord edema Workup for angioedema was initiated, Hypothermia The duration of her hypothermia is unclear as she previously refused vital signs for weeks Her hypothermia could have been related to underlying mental retardation and inability to seek warmth or side effect from her antipsychotic medications Her core temperature increased to the lower range of normal after warming with Bair hugger and receiving 2 liters of warmed saline in the ER SHe did not show evidence of septic physiology slightly elevated TSH but normal T4 indicating sick euthyroid, but this is not the cause of the patients hypothermia, Ataxia, She has had ataxia for approximately one month which could be an effect of hypothermia or related to her underlying neurologic disease She had a head CT that did not show any acute findings She continued to improve as an inpatient and was walking independently (at her baseline) on her own prior to discharge Poor oral intake She had poor PO intake at her group home and was seen by speech and swallow who recommended soft solids and thin liquids with meds whole or crushed in puree Her mental status improved and she was able to take regular diet Poor urine output She had poor urine output at group home but after foley placement she had 1200cc urine output This may be due to a medication side effect (she is on anticholinergics to prevent side effects from antipsychotics), Also has had poor oral intake recently After her foley was discontinued and she had ongoing urinary retention that required intermittent catheterization Urology was consulted and recommended scheduled intermittent catheterization and Cystex tid Patient frequently refuses catheterization nurses have had better luck with the catheterization about 1-2 hours after antipsychotics given All anticholinergics were stopped including Cogentin with some improvement in her bladder volumes It is unclear if there is a behavioral component to her urinary retention Her urinary retention

which improved her tinea corporis, significantly She will follow up with dermatology in [**2139-12-30**] Mental Retardation and agitation Her home psychiatric medications were continued including a slightly lower dose risperdal at 5mg po bid, The psychiatric consultants felt that given the patient's behavior has returned to baseline it may be best to avoid transition to clozaril as previously discussed given the greater propensity for anticholinergic side effects and that if behavioral issues and agitation issues do arise perhaps increasing the dose of risperdal should be the first step in management rather than an alternative anti-psychotic Sick euthyroid Mild TSH elevation to 77 with normal free T4, This should be repeated as an outpatient to screen for hypothyroidism Thrombocytopenia

way to sinus tachycardia and axis is now vertical Also non-specific inferolateral repolarization changes have appeared HEAD CT, [**2118-8-14**] No new focus of hemorrhage Overall unchanged picture of hemorrhagic metastases Brief Hospital Course 1 ALTERED MENTAL STATUS Most likely multifactorial but primarily from leptomeningeal involvement and hemorrhagic brain metastases with contributions from over-sedation from home benzodiazepines PNA and UTI On admission to the ICU patient was quite sedated and only minimally responsive Across his stay he became more responsive and was able to follow commands move all extremities and at times speak quite coherently although his mental status continued to wax and wane, During his hospitalization he also developed a left sided facial droop thought likely due to evolving brain metastases and leptomeningeal involvement 2 GOALS OF CARE/CODE STATUS The patient code status was made DNR/DNI during this admission and this was confirmed with the patient's wife A family meeting was held to discuss goals of care and it was decided to move towards hospice care after discharge The patient's wife however appeared to hold out ongoing hope for the patient's recovery and the patient himself expressed the desire to attempt one more round of Taxol Discharged with home VNA and bridge to hospice 3 METASTATIC MELANOMA WITH HEMORRHAGIC BRAIN METS Known mets to scalp neck groin brain s/[**Initials (NamePattern4) *, *], [**Last Name (NamePattern4) 16859**], [**First Name3 (LF) **] mass resection and ventriculostomy for obstructive hydrocephalus On Taxol at admission first dose 5/26 In previous discussions patient has been clear that he did not desire further surgical intervention for control of his brain mets He repeatedly stated his desire for one more attempt at treatment with Taxol which was decided against given the patient's disease progression despite taxol therapy Dexamethasone was continued for cerebral edema and all anticoagulation was held 4 FEVERS/PNA/UTI Fever and CXR on admission with consolidation at right base concerning for aspiration pneumonia as well as WBCs in U/A, No elevation of WBC Started on Vanc/Zosyn later changed to Vanc/Cefapime after blood cultures remained negative Urine Cx grew out enterococcus which was sensitive to ampicillin nitrofurantoin and, vancomycin 5 NAUSEA/VOMITING Likely related to leptomeningeal involvement and metastatic impingement on fourth ventricle versus recent chemo No evidence of increased intracranial pressure on head CT but during stay patient did develop left sided facial droop Could be related to vertigo in setting of additional brain edema as in recent admission He also has had dizziness and lighthededness with standing and sitting up and on previous admission patient had orthostatic hypotension Patient was treated with Ondansetron and Decadron 6 h/o DVT Dx in [**2-11**] Lovenox stopped on admission given hemorrhagic brain mets

tachycardia borderline hypotension and hypoglycemia  1 Sepsis secondary to ecoli bacteremia On presentation meet SIRS criteria with fevers tachycardia and mild bandemia from suspected infectious source especially given immunosuppression Pancultured in the emergency department and placed on empiric broad-spectrum antibiotics with vancomycin and cefepime To evaluate for etiology CXR and CT scan of abdomen was performed with no apparent abnormality besides stool impaction in the rectum Urinalysis did have minimal blood and white blood cells but culture returned negative Stool cx returned positive for cdiff and patient was started on flagyl Blood cx from [**10-5**] grew pansensitive ecoli and antibiotics were subsequently narrowed to ciprofloxacin (and flagyl), The most likely source of ecoli bacteremia was thought to be translocation from gut in setting of mild colitis, The patient was transiently hypotensive in the emergency department but responded to fluid boluses With antibiotic therapy she defervesced tachycardia resolved and subjective complaints of chills improved Surveillance blood cx from [**10-6**] were negative for 48 hrs pt was continued on cipro/flagyl but developed leukopenia and flagyl was discontinued (bc can contribute to leukopenia) and changed to PO vancomycin Authorization for PO vanco could not be obtained over the weekend and pt decided to leave against medical advice in lieu of waiting for vanco authorization Pt was advised to continue vanco for 2 weeks more after completing 2 week course of cipro She has outpt f/u in transplant clinic to have WBC count checked (in addition to INR and tacro levels as below), At time of discharge pt was abebrile >72 hrs had no diarrhea no abd pain, no N/V Of note mycophenolate mofetil was discontinued as well prior to discharge given leukopenia Bactrim and valcyte though also can cause leukopenia were continued as pt has been on these for a long time without complications Most likely leukopenia was due to recent initiation of flagyl and should improve on cipro/vanco regimen MMF was held until follow up as this may have been contributing to her neutropenia  2 ESRD s/p transplant History of lupus nephritis s/p renal transplant on cellcept tacrolimus and prednisone Baseline creatinine is in the 1s but has been slowly increasing since [**Month (only) 205**] and has been as high as 27 in the recent past Etiology of developping renal insufficiency is unclear CT scan with no evidence of obstruction urinalysis without active sediment to suggest recurrent lupus nephritis, The patient may have chronic volume depletion she is on bactrim for PCP, [**Name9 (PRE) **] which may artifactually increase creatinine Also it is unclear whether she is compliant with her immunosuppressants at home, A renal biopsy may be pursued as an outpatient During hospitalization renal function was trended daily and patient continued on immunosuppressants with bactrim for PCP, [**Name Initial (PRE) **] Daily tacrolimus levels were also followed with level adjusted as needed Goal level, [**7-20**] tacro level 64 at discharge per renal consult continued 2mg [**Hospital1 **] dosing of tacrolimus Cellcept was discontinued prior to discharge given leukopenia (as above), Pt has f/u in renal transplant clinic to have tacro levels rechecked and to check WBC count will modulate immunosuppression regimen based on those results  3 Antiphospholipid syndrome on longterm anticoagulation with warfarin for history of APLS (Anticardiolipin Ab's showing elevated IgG and normal IgM in

Surgical or Invasive Procedure NA History of Present Illness, The patient is a [**Age over 90 **]-year-old female with past medical history significant for stable coronary disease PAF and a six-month history of low back pain left greater than right with radiation down her left lateral thigh to her left calf, The pain is intermittent sharp and electric radiating down her left lateral thigh to her left lateral calf; she has weakness in her left hip flexor, She recently had a lumber nerve root block with immediate relief from the bupivicaine and mild improvement with the steroid injection A week before admission she developed worsening left sciatic pain with significant limitation in ambulation, She was brought in by her daughter for uncontrolled pain and inability to perform activities of daily living She reports pain denies fever chills nausea vomiting diarrhea loss of urine or stool There is not a significant change in the quality of her radiculopathy rather in the severity It is worse with sitting and standing for a prolonged time and worse when getting from a sitting to a standing position She states that the pain is worse when she lays on her left side as well, The pain is slightly better with rest and lying on her right side The patient states that she has been able to walk with only a cane but over the last six months the pain has gotten so bad that at time she needs to walk with a walker and this has stopped her from going to church She denies any numbness any weakness or any bowel or bladder incontinence Past Medical History AF since [**2177-2-27**] CVA in

cavity is unusually small Overall left ventricular systolic function is normal (LVEF 70%), Tissue Doppler imaging suggests an increased left ventricular filling pressure (PCWP>18mmHg) Transmitral Doppler and tissue velocity imaging are consistent with Grade III/IV (severe) LV diastolic dysfunction Right ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are normal There are focal calcifications in the aortic arch, The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is not present No aortic regurgitation is seen The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened There is no mitral valve prolapse There is severe mitral annular calcification There is moderate thickening of the mitral valve chordae AT LEAST moderate (2+) mitral regurgitation is seen, [Due to acoustic shadowing the severity of mitral regurgitation may be significantly UNDERestimated] The left ventricular inflow pattern suggests a restrictive filling abnormality with elevated left atrial pressure The tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly thickened, The supporting structures of the tricuspid valve are thickened/fibrotic Moderate, [2+] tricuspid regurgitation is seen There is mild pulmonary artery systolic hypertension There is no pericardial effusion IMPRESSION severe asymmetric left ventricular hypertrophy; small left ventricular cavity; severe left ventricular diastolic dysfunction;, at least moderate (and probably significantly more) mitral regurgitation, [**9-9**] CT abd/pelvis with IV contrast CT OF THE ABDOMEN WITH IV CONTRAST A left pleural effusion with associated atelectasis is stable The lung bases are otherwise clear, The liver gallbladder spleen adrenal glands and kidneys appear unremarkable Note is again made of a small right renal hypodensity measuring 6 mm likely representing a renal cyst There is evidence of periportal edema and anasarca A large left retroperitoneal hematoma now measures 8 (transverse) x 7 (AP) x 13 (coronal) cm and allowing for measurement differences has not changed in size compared to the prior study in terms of size No areas of active extravasation are noted on the arterial phase imaging and the density of the retroperitoneal hematoma does not increase with delayed imaging, No new hemorrhage is identified The abdominal portions of the large and small bowel are unremarkable Heavy calcification of the abdominal aorta is noted and a focal area of stenosis at the level of the pancreas is additionally noted CT OF THE PELVIS WITH IV CONTRAST Evaluation of the pelvis is limited secondary to streak artifact from left hip prosthesis A Foley balloon is present within the bladder The rectum and sigmoid colon are grossly unremarkable IMPRESSION Large left retroperitoneal hematoma essentially unchanged in size compared to the examination of nine hours prior No CT evidence of active extravasation Brief Hospital Course ACUTE ON CHRONIC LUMBOSACRAL RADICULOPATHY, Despite multimodality pain regimen the patient's pain remained poorly controlled except when treated with ketorolac, Unfortunately this is a potentially dangerous medication in this woman with advanced age mildly reduced renal function and on warfarin and plavix A pain consult was obtained, but they did not add much to the present management MRI of LS spine showed no evidence of nerve root impingement cauda equina or canal stenosis but incidental note was made of a possible left pelvic mass, This was further evaluated by CT It is possible that some of the pain and weakness may be related to an iliopsoas process  ACUTE RENAL FAILURE related to

showed an RP bleed This was thought to be [**12-30**] increased INR and she was given 1 mg sc vitamin k and 2 mg po vitamin k, No recent procedures No change in medications Her coumadin was given on [**9-5**] but held since [**9-6**] because of increased INR, She also is hyponatremic which was thought to be iatrogenic from D51/2 NS maintenance fluids given continuously despite an initial sodium

trauma by history Given 2U pRBCs during admission Hematocrit stable over rest of hospital course Conservative management -*Given patient's significant retroperitoneal bleed with hct drop and hypotension the patient's coumadin aspirin and plavix were all discontinued I recommend that patient not be restarted on coumadin in the future, In my opinion the risk of recurrent significant RP bleed outweighs the cardioembolic benefits in the setting of the patient's a-fib, The patient can be restarted on aspirin +/- plavix per PCP discretion at future outpatient PCP, [**Name Initial (PRE)

bulb and mucosa suggestive of Barrett's esophagus Patient's ulcers were clipped injected with epinephrine and had thermal therapy which stopped the bleeding Biopsy wasn't performed at the time due to concern for increased bleeding On transfer to OMED patient was hemodynamically stable but then began to have drop in hematocrit, He received three units of blood without an appropriate increase in hematocrit He remained guaiac positive had two large bore pIVs for access and continued on [**Hospital1 **] pantoprazole He had serial hematocrits checked and was stable for 48 hours prior to discharge Patient was scheduled for outpatient endoscopy to reassess the ulcers and for biopsy of the lymphoid hyperplasia Patient was advised to avoid all NSAIDs He will have serial hematocrits checked by home VNA  STEMI Patient was admitted with initial STE in V3 but with a progressive rise in cardiac enzymes He was noted to have evolving ST changes since admission with peak troponin and was diagnosed as having a STEMI A cardiology consult was obtained and recommended stopping patient's amlodipine and digoxin and starting atorvastatin lisinopril and metoprolol which were started when patient was hemodynamically stable from a GI bleed perspective Patient's cardiac enzymes were trended and he was found to have continued upward trend in troponin to peak 224 with gradual decrease in CK and CKMB Cardiology was reconsulted and felt that elevation in troponin was not an indication for cardiac catheterization and opted for medical management Patient was not placed on heparin due to bleeding risk He was not anticoagulated for his atrial fibrillation due to bleeding risk and due to concern for poor compliance as an outpatient A repeat echocardiogram was performed which showed global hypokinesis and a depressed EF from 40% to 30-35% possibly from stunned myocardium He will need to have follow up with his outpatient cardiologist He remained on telemetry with no events He will need a stress test as an outpatient He remained chest pain free through his admission  Lymphoma Patient's lymphoma was stable He received one dose of neupogen as an inpatient but had a

requiring liver transplantation the patient is currently on liver transplant list 2 Hypertension 3 History of nephrolithiasis MEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION 1, Aldactone 50, mg 2, Lasix 20 mg 3 Flagyl 250 mg three times per day 4 Quinine 325 mg once per day 5 Protonix 40 mg once per day 6 Magnesium oxide 800 mg twice per day 7 Oxycodone 2 mg to 4 mg as needed ALLERGIES, The patient has allergies to CODEINE (which causes gastrointestinal upset) SOCIAL HISTORY, He lives at home with his wife [**Name (NI) **] is a past alcohol abuser who now works as a substance abuse counselor FAMILY HISTORY Significant for father who died of a myocardial infarction at the age of 38 PHYSICAL EXAMINATION, ON PRESENTATION, On admission the patient was afebrile He had a blood pressure of 130/58 a pulse of 70 a respiratory rate of 20 and was saturating 97% on room air, He was in no apparent distress He was anicteric, His pupils were reactive His extraocular movements were intact The lungs were clear bilaterally His cardiac examination showed normal first heart sounds and second heart sounds with a 2/6 systolic murmur at the right upper sternal border His abdomen was soft mildly distended and nontender He had no peripheral edema PERTINENT LABORATORY VALUES, ON PRESENTATION, He had a white blood cell count of 56 his hematocrit was 284 and he had platelets of 101 He had an INR of 19 Chemistry-7 showed an initial creatinine of 42 with a potassium of 67 After gentle fluids and treatment for his potassium he had a repeat potassium of 57 and a creatinine of 39 He had an alanine-aminotransferase of 57 his aspartate aminotransferase was 166 his alkaline phosphatase was 101 and his total bilirubin was 37 PERTINENT RADIOLOGY/IMAGING, An electrocardiogram showed a normal sinus rhythm There were no peaked T waves Otherwise his electrocardiogram was normal BRIEF SUMMARY OF HOSPITAL COURSE, The patient was admitted for his acute renal insufficiency His Lasix and his Aldactone were held His hyperkalemia responded well to his Kayexalate therapy The patient was noted to have some mild periorbital erythema and edema on the right side of his face He was initially started on doxycycline for this presumed preseptal cellulitis, The patient's creatinine did initially improve; however it started to increase again slowly during the course of his hospital stay, Initially it was felt that the patient's initial presentation of acute renal insufficiency was secondary to aggressive diuresis; however in the setting of his diuretics being held and his continued increase in his creatinine it was possible that he could have the initial stages of hepatorenal syndrome, The patient has had elevated creatinines on previous hospitalizations presumed to be related to hepatorenal syndrome, The patient was started on octreotide and midodrine Also in the setting of his acute renal insufficiency his tetracycline was held as it was possible that this could be a contributing factor An Ophthalmology consultation was obtained which showed just some very mild preseptal cellulitis with no orbital signs or symptoms suggestive of an orbital cellulitis The patient's doxycycline was discontinued in favor of Keflex, The patient did have urine eosinophils and sediment checked He had bland sediment which was not consistent with an acute tubular necrosis type picture The patient was also transfused with 2 units of packed red blood cells for a low hematocrit early on during the course of his hospital stay The patient did not have any upper endoscopy as his anemia was not suspected to be secondary to esophageal varices, The patient's creatinine continued to rise in the setting of his octreotide and midodrine therapy Because of this albumin 25 grams intravenously once per day was also started On [**2138-3-29**] the patient became encephalopathic Blood cultures and urine cultures were sent and he did have an episode of occult-blood positive stools In the setting of his encephalopathy his renal function did improve; however he was transferred to the Unit for further observation A nasogastric lavage was done in the setting of his occult-blood positive stool, The nasogastric lavage was negative for blood He did have a STAT head computed tomography which was negative for bleed All sedatives were discontinued and he was started on lactulose therapy A chest x-ray there was negative for a pneumonia The patient did have serial blood cultures done He did have a total of [**6-26**], blood cultures positive for methicillin-resistant coagulase-negative Staphylococcus His mental status did improve on lactulose therapy The origin of his staphylococcal bacteremia was still uncertain In this setting he did have a diagnostic paracentesis done which was negative for spontaneous bacterial peritonitis, The patient was started on vancomycin for his high-grade bacteremia He did have a transesophageal echocardiogram done which was negative for endocarditis Per the Infectious Disease staff it was recommended that he be treated with four to six weeks of vancomycin from the date of his last positive blood cultures which were [**2138-3-30**], The patient was transferred back to the floor with an improved mental status and improved renal function He did well on the floor His hematocrit remained stable, He remained afebrile on vancomycin The patient also completed a course of levofloxacin for his preseptal cellulitis For his preseptal cellulitis he received a total of 10 days of antibiotics which included doxycycline Keflex and levofloxacin, The patient did have good nutritional intake while on the floor His creatinine remained in the 16 to 19 range on the floor and stable His baseline creatinine is around 1, He was not started on diuretics at discharge A peripherally inserted central catheter line was placed for administration of intravenous vancomycin for his high-grade methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus epidermitis bacteremia The patient was seen by Physical Therapy and was discharged from their service as he had no acute physical therapy needs The patient did have a candidal infection of his groin area which was treated with topical anti-fungal medications to which he responded well to Toward the end of his hospital stay the patient did have increased diarrhea His lactulose was held which improved his diarrhea somewhat; however he did complain of increased diarrhea He did have Clostridium difficile toxins times three days which were sent These were negative for Clostridium difficile The patient was discharged on no diuretics; however the possibility of restarting Aldactone 50 mg will be considered as an outpatient He will be discharged with a total course of four to six weeks of vancomycin The start date on his vancomycin was [**2138-3-30**], CONDITION AT DISCHARGE Fair DISCHARGE STATUS To home DISCHARGE DIAGNOSES 1 Hepatitis C cirrhosis;

Complaint SOB Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure, None History of Present Illness, [**Age over 90 **] yo female with hx of HTN afib ?, PE multiinfarct dementia and recurrent UTI who presents with lethargy hypoxia and LE erythema Pt is aphasic at baseline Per notes from ED and PCP coverage the patient was being treated for recurrent UTI with a course of levofloxacin started on [**6-7**] but was otherwise doing well Last night she was noted to be more lethargic than normal with increasing SOB She was noted to be hypoxic with O2 Sats of 80% so was transferred to the ED, In the ED she had a fever to 1018 with intermittent hypoxia that improved to 98% with 4LNS oxygen  She was given Clindamycin 600mg IV x1 for LE cellulitis and a dose of Levofloxacin 500mg IV for possible UTI For her hypoxia she was given 20mg IV Lasix and a combivent neb with significant improvement with CTA neg for PE and LENI neg for DVT She continued to have intermittent hypoxia of unclear etiology so was transferred to the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] for closer monitoring  , In the MICU the patient was treated with CTX and Vanc for UTI/cellulitis Also diuresed Patient improved and sent to floor,

lopressor x 3 with out response in HR Transferred back unit for further mgt of HR and hypoxia where she was started on a diltiazem drip; CTA was without evidence of PE Course complicated by persistent hypotension requiring multiple fluid boluses; this resolved after the discontinuation of the diltiazem drip She was started on an amiodarone load with conversion into NSR, Her O2 sat improved with diuresis, A picc line was placed and she was started on aztreonam (instead of macrobid) for UTI She was transferred back to the general medical floor on [**2175-6-16**], Currently she has a new rash

Hypotension/Sepsis, On admission patient met SIRS criteria with fever tachypnea tachycardia and lactate of 25 consistent with sepsis Infectious source was likely biliary tract vs HD line infection however also considered was pulmonary source w/ new O2 requirements although more likely from capillary leak/CHF Patient has remained fluid responsive intially without need for pressors The underlying infection was treated with IV vancomycin/unasyn/gentamycin for synergy until cultures at OSH grew enterobacter at which point only zosyn was continued with appropriate coverage, The patients lactate level fevers and WBC were trended and returned to [**Location 213**] Zosyn was switched to Ciprofloxacin after the patient developed a drug rash  #Mechanical ventilation Patient came to the ICU intubated s/p ERCP on a propofol drip, Initially he was hypotensive which was treated with IV fluids and discontinued propofol switching to fentanyl/versed for sedation Shortly thereafter the patient became restless agitated and continued to be hypotensive He was given 10mg vecuronium and paralyzed for arterial line placement and, foley placement His labile blood pressures also exacerbated his already fluid-overloaded state making it difficult to wean off the vent The initiation of hemodialysis effectively controlled his BP and fluid status and on day 7 after his second ERCP he was extubated and started on CPAP, overnight  # Gallstone Pancreatitis, On admission the patient had elevated LFTs pancreatic enzymes bilirubin and alk phos, His levels slowly trended down post-ERCP except bilirubin and AP which continued to rise The patient experienced intermittent epigastric discomfort which prompted a RUQ US which showed a fatty liver but the common bile duct non-well

[**2200-2-15**], Over the three-day interval there has been little change in the overall appearance of the heterogeneous but predominantly hyperattenuating lobulated process centered in the extra-axial space of the left parietovertex This appears to \"mold\" to the contour of the subjacent convexity where there is focal low-attenuation in the immediate subcortical white matter corresponding to the FLAIR-signal abnormality in this region which may represent edema secondary to venous congestion gliosis or both The overall appearance is most suggestive of a partially calcified en plaque meningioma though there is no specific evidence of \"reactive change\" in the suprajacent inner table of the skull There has been no other short-interval change IMPRESSION, No short-interval change in the overall appearance with the lobulated predominantly hyperdense process in the extra-axial space at the left parietovertex given its stability and MR [**Date Range **] more likely an en plaque meningioma partially calcified accounting for the MR [**First Name (Titles) 16313**], [**Last Name (Titles) **], Moreover the findings on both this exam and the recent enhanced MR study raise the serious possibility of at least partial invasion of the immediately subjacent superior sagittal sinus without definite thrombosis and possible venous obstruction-related edema in local white matter If this will affect therapeutic decision dedicated MR, [**First Name (Titles) **], [**Last Name (Titles) **] venography might be considered MRI Brain, [**2200-2-15**] FINDINGS, The study is significantly limited due to patient motion artifacts There is enhancement noted in the area of known hemorrhage in the left parieto- occipital region compared to the pre-contrast sequences done on the prior study However the etiology of enhancement is not clear as there is significant amount of hemorrhage in this location as seen on the prior CT and MR studies Mildly dilated ventricles are visualized, not adequately assessed IMPRESSION 1 Study significantly limited due to motion artifacts Enhancement noted in the left parieto-occipital region partly extending along the dura the etiology of which is uncertain as this is in the region of the known hemorrhage Repeat evaluation after resolution of the hemorrhage can be considered to evaluate for any underlying vascular or space-occupying lesion Close followup with CT scan can also be considered as, clinically indicated Brief Hospital Course, The patient was admitted on [**2200-2-14**] to the neurosurgery service after a mental status change at the nursing home He was admitted with a presumed SDH on the CT scan However the patient had an MRI which revealed a mass resembling a meningioma There was no hemorrhage there The patient was transferred out of the ICU on [**2200-2-18**], He was evaluated by PT and a speech/swallowing therapist PT felt that he was safe to be discharged back the his nursing home on [**2200-2-19**], On [**2-19**] he was also able to take in thin liquids and pureed solids without difficulty He had his foley catheter removed on [**2-18**] but had urinary retention A Coud??????, catheter was placed that night and he was discharged with it in place Flomax was started as well and bladder training was begun He may be able to have it removed in a day or so at the nursing home, The patient should follow up with a urologist The patient was made DNR/DNI in the hospital by his health care proxy as well as for the ambulance ride Palliative care and medical consults were obtained to assist in management of the patient, His medications were optimized due to his mental status changes Additionally a family meeting with all 3 teams occurred It was felt that surgery would not benefit the

connective tissue disease on medical immunosuppression with prednisone and leflunamide and recurrent digit osteomyelitis who returns with fevers and lip swelling  #Angioedema The patient was evaluated by Allergy who felt the most likely etiology was the newly started ACEI (started 5d prior to noted symptoms), There was never any evidence of respiratory compromise hypotension or other signs concerning for anaphylaxis Allergy serologies (tryptase C1 inhibitor and C2) are pending at time of discharge Steroids were transitioned to oral On discharge patient was scheduled to complete steroid taper over 3 days (20mg x1d 10mg x1d 75mg ongoing as home dose), She received pepcid and benadryl x48h, and then fexofenadine x48h, The presenting lip swelling tingling resolved within 24h and remained absent during her admission She is scheduled for follow-up with Allergy within 1 week of discharge She was instructed to avoid ACEI in the future The potential use of [**Last Name (un) **] in this setting remains controversial and formal recommendations regarding future use of [**Last Name (un) **] was deferred to the Allergy service  #Fever Initial fever and bandemia were concerning for infection Patient remained afebrile after initial T103F on admission Of note there was consideration for prednisone related fever suppression and the patient was advised to continue to monitor for fever during prednisone taper following discharge  Per discussion with Allergy ACE related angioedema was likely not an etiology in fever Most likely sources were felt to be (1) persistent osteomyelitis of the R digits versus (2) CVC endovascular infection After coordinated discussion with the patient's in-patient and out-patient attendings (ID Rheumatology Surgery Medicine) the decision was made to remove the port Rationale included (a) prior positive CVC culture with CoNS in the setting of CoNS growing from R hand OR cultures (b) persistent port site tenderness (c) limited anticipated use of Port for next several months [immunosuppressive regimen is being deferred until completion of Fluconazole course which is anticipated to end in [**2145-11-30**]] (d) potential future risk for fungal colonization given known Candidal osteomyelitis There was low concern for other mechanisms of infection including resistant organisms ([**Female First Name (un) 564**] noted as Fluc sensitive MSSA CoNS both Vancomycin sensitive) non gram positive organisms (Bld Cx remained negative during this admission; Bld/Port Cx x2) metastatic infection (recent TTE negative for

(NamePattern1) 8817**], [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **]) who will assist in coordination of PICC placement, She was evaluated by the IV team prior to discharge who felt out-patient PICC placement with consideration for IR guidance was an appropriate plan Of note the removed Port-A-Cath tip should be sent for culture (bacterial fungal AFB)  , #HTN Patient's blood pressures remained 130-150s/80s-110s Metoprolol was increased from 25mg, [**Hospital1, **] to 50mg, [**Hospital1, **] with improvement in blood pressures Additional regimen changes were deferred to the outpatient setting following steroid taper given potential steroid related contribution to noted hypertension Patient experienced Metoprolol related GI upset/dysphagia which resolved with administration w/ food Patient

BRIEF SUMMARY OF HOSPITAL COURSE: ASSESSMENT AND PLAN: A 69 year-old female with past medical history of coronary artery disease status post MI with stent to RCA in [**2165**] presents from outside hospital after ruling in for myocardial infarction. The patient transferred here for cardiac catheterization. 1. Cardiac - Coronaries the patient with known disease, increased Troponin and index at outside hospital with EKG changes all suggestive of acute coronary syndrome. At presentation the patient was chest pain free times three days. The patient was originally continued on Heparin, Aggrastat, beta blocker, aspirin, statin and Gemfibrozil. Plendil was discontinued in favor of starting an Ace inhibitor. The patient underwent cardiac catheterization on [**2171-4-16**] and this showed one vessel coronary artery disease. The patient underwent successful stenting of 95% mid RCA stenosis. Ejection fraction was preserved. The patient suffered from no flow phenomenon requiring Diltiazem and Nitroglycerin secondary to chest pain and ST elevations with stent deployment. The patient also suffered complete heart block secondary to Diltiazem in cath lab requiring transient pacer. The patient was transferred to the CCU with chest pain and persistent ST elevations. Aggrastat was stopped prior to catheterization secondary to epistasis and guaiac positive stools. In the cath lab the patient stabilized on Nitro drip. Complete heart block resolved and pacing wire was taken out. The patient was transferred to the floor without chest pain and with complete resolution of EKG changes to continue medical management. The patient had no further episodes of chest pain throughout her hospital stay. The patient's Ace inhibitor was changed to Lisinopril for two day dosing. The patient continued on Gemfibrozil and Fluvastatin for cholesterol and was to complete a 30 day course of Plavix. Estimated ejection fraction at cardiac catheterization was 60%. 2. Hematocrit - The patient with a hematocrit drop peri catheterization thought to be secondary to anticoagulation. The patient received three units of packed red blood cells. The patient hematocrit low was 26.[**4-22**]. ON day of discharge [**2171-4-21**] the patient's hematocrit bumped to 39.1. 3. Infectious Disease - The patient had a temperature spike to 101.2 F the evening of [**4-18**]. The patient was started on Bactrim for mildly positive urinalysis which consisted of large blood, small leukocytes, negative nitrites, 5 whites, moderate bacteria, one squamous epithelial cell. The patient had received temporary Foley catheter in the CCU and complained of mild urinary burning after its being taken out. The patient defervesced over the next few days but had a low grade temperature on the evening of [**2171-4-19**]. The patient was changed to Ciprofloxacin and chest x-ray was unrevealing. Blood cultures were drawn which showed no growth to date at the time of discharge. The patient to be followed as an outpatient and instructed to take her temperature and if over 100 to seek medical attention. The patient to complete a seven day course for UTI. Urine culture was uninterpretable due to fecal contamination. DISCHARGE FOLLOW UP: The patient to follow up with PCP next week as well as Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 7047**] for primary cardiologist. DISCHARGE CONDITION: Stable. DISCHARGE STATUS: To home. DISCHARGE DIAGNOSIS: 1. Coronary artery disease. 2. Hypercholesterolemia. 3. UTI. DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS: 1. Atenolol 25 milligrams po q day. 2. Aspirin 325 milligrams po q day. 3. Lisinopril 20 milligrams po q day. 4. Gemfibrozil 600 milligrams po bid. 5. Protonix 40 milligrams po q day. 6. Fluvastatin 20 milligrams po q day. 7. Plavix 75 milligrams po q day times 28 days. 8. Ciprofloxacin 250 milligrams po bid times six days. CODE STATUS: The patient is full code.

She had received one cycle of carboplatin and Taxol chemotherapy, and 5 doses of IV chemotherapy with intraperitoneal cisplatin and 4 doses of intraperitoneal Taxol. A CT scan revealed a large saddle embolus in the right main pulmonary artery, which nearly completely occluded the right lower lobe pulmonary artery, and wedge shaped, parenchymal opacity in the right lower lobe, which may represent pulmonary infarction. The patient was started on IV heparin and remained hemodynamically stable. She was given cefepime in ED. The patient continued to experience RUQ pain, R sided pleuritic chest pain and mild shortness of breath with exertion. She was initiated on lovenox for long-term anticoagulation and discharged on Amlodipine, Atorvastatin, Hydrochlorothiazide, Magnesium Hydroxide, and Enoxaparin.\\nDrug_1: intraperitoneal, Drug_2: cisplatin\\n\\nOutput:\\nRoute-Drug\\n\\nExplanation:\\nCisplatin is given by intraperitoneal (IP) route, so relation between intraperitoneal and cisplatin is 'Route-Drug'.\\n\\nGiven a text of discharge summary as context and two drug names, generated one of the 8 relations between given drugs: (1) Strength-Drug, (2) Dosage-Drug, (3) Duration-Drug, (4) Frequency-Drug, (5) Form-Drug, (6) Route-Drug, (7) Reason-Drug, and (8) ADE-Drug.\\n\\nParagraph:\\n\\nContext: Admission Date: [**2143-12-27**] Discharge Date: [**2144-1-3**] Date of Birth: [**2069-9-2**] Sex: M Service: MEDICINE Allergies: Aspirin / lisinopril / Nifedipine / Cephalexin / Nafcillin Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 2782**] Chief Complaint: Abnormal labs Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: None History of Present Illness: This is a 74-year-old gentleman with a pmhx. significant for dCHF, afib on coumadin, CKD, MSSA/GBS bacteremia, and was recently discharged on [**2143-12-19**] for compression fracture of T11 vertebrea and afib with RVR who presents to the ED at the request of his nurse practioner for elevated potassium. Mr. [**Known lastname 19829**] had been evaluated in the infectious disease clinic on [**12-25**] and had routine labs drawn, at which time his potassium was found to be 5.7. No headache, fevers, chills, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, or other concerning signs or symptoms. . Labs were significant for a creatinine of 3.3 up from a baseline of 1.5 and a potassium of 6.1. Brother died of cancer of unknown primary. Three daughters are alive and well. There are simple atheroma in the descending thoracic aorta. The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened. IMPRESSION: Mitral and aortic leaflets are thickened but no discrete vegetation is identified. Moderate mitral regurgitation with thickened leaflets but without discrete vegetation. Stable mild cardiomegaly evident. Mr. [**Known lastname 19829**] was given a prednisone burst ( 5 days of 40mg prednisone) with significant improvement in his symptoms.
