About 2 . 106 nuclei were incubated with increasing quantities of MNase ( 0 . 04 - 1 . 6 units ) or DNase I ( 0 . 25 - 16 units ) . Digestion time at 37 degrees C was 10 min for MNase and 2 min for DNase I . Digestions were stopped by adding SDS to 1 % and EDTA to 50 mM . DNAs were prepared by proteinase K digestion followed by phenol - chloroform extraction and isopropanol precipitation . To test the association of histone H3 with chromatin in control and p150 - depleted cells , isolated nuclei were incubated on ice for 30 min in buffer 2 ( 50 mM Hepes [ pH7 . 9 ] , 20 % Glycerol , 3 mM MgCl2 , 0 . 1 % IGEPAL , 0 . 5 mM DTT , 0 . 5 mM PMSF ) supplemented with either 0 . 1 M , 0 . 3 M , 0 . 45 M , 0 . 7 M , or 1 M NaCl .",
